There was a woodcutter.
He used to cut woods in the bank of the river.
One day his axe fell into the river.
He started crying.
Then came the fairy who gave him a golden axe and asked him whether that belongs to him.

He said no it is not his own..
Then the fairy dived into the river and came out with a silver axe.
The woodcutter replied it was not his axe.
Again, the fairy dived in and came out with a wooden axe.
Now, the woodcutter accepted it from the fairy.
The impressed fairy gave him all the three axes.
He said yes it is my axe.
