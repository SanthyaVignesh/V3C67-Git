There was a woodcutter.
He used to cut woods in the bank of the river.
One day his axe fell into the river.
He started crying.
Then came the fairy who gave him a golden axe and asked him whether that belongs to him.
He said yes it is my axe.
The fairy was not pleased with the greed of the woodcutter and left him without helping.
